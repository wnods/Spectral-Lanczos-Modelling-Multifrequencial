# Spectral-Lanczos-Modelling-Multifrequencial
SLDM uses the Lanczos algorithm to calculate approximations of the modes (eigenvalues ​​and eigenvectors) of the matrix associated with the problem. These cars are used for field estimation for a given frequency. This technique is particularly useful when the problem involves large and sparse matrices as it reduces the size of the initial problem.
